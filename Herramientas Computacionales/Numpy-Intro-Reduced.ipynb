In this context, it is important to remark some of the so-called `vectorial` computation. Let's give an example. Imagine a two dimensional vector $a$. How would you represent it using python? You coul use either a list, a tuple, etc:\n","\n","    a1 = [x, y]\n","    a2 = (x, y)\n","    \n","Of course, it can be  generalized to more dimensions:\n","\n","    a1 = [x, y, z, w]\n","    a2 = [0.0, -0.9, 1, -3, 9, ... , 90]\n","   \n","Managing vectors by using these typical python constructs is very good from a general programmer point of view, but it has its costs. For example, iterating over a lits by means of a for loop could be very slow. Actually, for typical problemas of computational mathematics and physics, only homogeneous storage structs with fast access are needed, like the arrays of languages like c++, fortran, etc. Arrays might be more limited than general lists, but could vastly outperform lists and tuples for vectorial computations. The `numpy` package provides array like structs to perform fast mathematical operations on numerical data.\n","\n","Furthermore, vectorial operations are natural on numpy arrays. But what is a vectorial operation? Let's assume we have a vector $v$ of $n$-components. What would be the meaning of something like\n","    u = sin(v)\n","? in the context of vectorial computing, it would mean to apply the function `sin` to every component of the vector `v`, therefore $u_i = \\sin(v_i)$. In general, given a function $f$, the expression $u = f(v)$ means $u_i = f(v_i)$. Numpy allows for this kind of computing.
